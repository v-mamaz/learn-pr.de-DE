Imagine you're managing storage for an online retailer. You need tools to create, update, and delete your user and product data. Azure Cosmos DB provides SDKs for .NET, .NET Core, Java, Node.js, and Python.

In this module, you will build a .NET Core console application in Visual Studio Code to create, update, and delete user records, query your data, and perform stored procedures using C#.

Visual Studio has a convenient extension for Azure Cosmos DB so you can easily see the database, collection, and documents you created in the previous modules, plus you can create new resources using the extension, and copy your connection string without having to open the Azure portal.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:  

- Create an application to store and query data in Azure Cosmos DB
- Use the Integrated Terminal in Visual Studio Code to quickly create a console application
- Add Azure Cosmos DB functionality with the help of the Azure Cosmos DB extension for Visual Studio Code
