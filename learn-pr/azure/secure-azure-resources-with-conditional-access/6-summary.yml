  title: 'Knowledge Check: Azure Active Directory and conditional access'
  questions:
  - content: 'Azure AD is just an AD DS domain controller running in Azure.'
    choices: 
    - content: 'True'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: While Azure AD performs many of the same functions as traditional AD DS, it's a cloud-based multi-tenant, directory, and identity management service.
    - content: 'False'
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: Correct! AD DS is a server role on Windows Server. Azure AD is a cloud-based multi-customer public directory service.
  - content: 'What three items should exist in a successful conditional access policy?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'User or group, application, time of day'
      isCorrect: false
      correctExplanation: Time of day is not an option that's available in conditional access rules.
    - content: 'User or group, application, control to be enforced'
      isCorrect: true
      incorrectExplanation: Correct! Selecting these three items will create self-contained functional conditional access rules.
    - content: 'User or group, Linux OS, control to be enforced'
      isCorrect: false
      correctExplanation: While you can target some device platforms, Linux isn't currently supported.
  - content: 'How would you modify the conditional access rule that we created to require Multi-Factor Authentication for all users?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Under **Access Controls** > **Session**, select **Use application-enforced restrictions**.'
      isCorrect: false
      correctExplanation: Sorry, that option won't modify the rule appropriately.
    - content: 'Change the user and group assignment from **Select users and groups** to **All users**.'
      isCorrect: true
      incorrectExplanation: Correct! Selecting all users will make this policy apply to any user who triggers this conditional access rule. It's suggested that you create a group and add it to the exclude list for instances where users may need to bypass Multi-Factor Authentication due to lost or forgotten methods.
