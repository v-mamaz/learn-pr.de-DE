Adding data and querying data in your database should be straightforward. 

Imagine you work for an online clothing retailer and you need to add inventory data to your e-commerce database in Azure Cosmos DB. Once the data is in the database, you can query it by using familiar SQL queries (yes, just like the ones you use in SQL Server) and perform complex operations by using stored procedures and user-defined functions (UDFs).

Azure Cosmos DB provides a Data Explorer in the Azure portal that you can use to perform all these operations: adding data, modifying data, and creating and running stored procedures. The Data Explorer can be used in the Azure portal or it can be undocked and used in a standalone web browser, providing additional space to work with your data.
