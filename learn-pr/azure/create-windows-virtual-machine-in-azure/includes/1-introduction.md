Imagine you work for a company that does data processing and storage for traffic cameras. The video streams are analyzed, categorized, and processed to identify faces and license plates at particular times. The information is uploaded to Azure Data Lake and a searchable index is generated for law enforcement.

These video streams use a range of different codecs and resolutions. You need to run several Windows-based proprietary software packages to carry out the initial processing and encode them into a common video format. Since new formats are regularly released, it's beneficial to do the video processing on virtual machines (VMs). The proprietary packages can then be added and updated without stopping the entire system.

Azure provides a robust virtual machine hosting solution that can meet your needs. Let's explore how to create and work with Windows virtual machines in Azure.
