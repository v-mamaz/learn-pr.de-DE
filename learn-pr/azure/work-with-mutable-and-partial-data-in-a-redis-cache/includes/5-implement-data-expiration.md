Here, you'll add an expiration time to our data in the Azure Redis Cache.

## Add an expiration time

In the last exercise, we left off with the following code in **Program.cs**.

```csharp
using (RedisClient redisClient = new RedisClient(redisConnectionString))
{
    //Create the transaction
    var transaction = redisClient.CreateTransaction();

    //Add multiple operations to the transaction
    transaction.QueueCommand(c => c.Set("MyKey1", "MyValue1"));
    transaction.QueueCommand(c => c.Set("MyKey2", "MyValue2"));

    //Commit and get result of transaction
    var transactionResult = transaction.Commit();

    if(transactionResult)
        Console.WriteLine("Transaction committed");
    else
        Console.WriteLine("Transaction failed to commit");
}
```

Letâ€™s add an expiration of 15 seconds to both **MyKey1** and **MyKey2**.

1. Add the following code before you commit the transaction

    ```csharp
    //Add an expiration time
    transaction.QueueCommand(c => ((RedisNativeClient)c).Expire("MyKey1", 15));
    transaction.QueueCommand(c => ((RedisNativeClient)c).Expire("MyKey2", 15));
    ```

    In this code, the **Expire** method is a part of the **RedisNativeClient**. To access the method, we must first cast our object.

## Verify the expiration

Now that we added the code to expire our data, lets run the program and check that the data is removed from Redis.

1. Run the program.

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```
    
1. Switch back to the Azure Redis Console in the Azure portal.

1. To verify that the data is still there, issue the following command:

    ```
    get MyKey1
    ```

1. After 15 seconds, issue the command again. You should see that the data is no longer there.
