We used `Debian` for the image to create the virtual machine. Azure has several standard VM images you can use to create a virtual machine. 

You can get a list of the available images using the `az vm image list --output table` command. This will output the most popular images that are part of an offline list built into the Azure CLI. However, there are _hundreds_ of image options available in the Azure Marketplace. 

> [!TIP]
> You can get a full list by adding the `--all` flag to the command. Since the list of images in the Marketplace is very large, it is helpful to filter the list with the `--publisher` or `â€“-offer` options.

Some images are only available in certain locations. Try adding the `--location [location]` flag to the command to scope the results to ones available in the region where you want to create the virtual machine. For example, type the following into Azure Cloud Shell to get a list of images available in the `eastus` region.

```azurecli
az vm image list --location eastus --output table
```

> [!TIP]
> These are the standard images that are provided by Azure. Keep in mind that you can also [create and upload your own custom images](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/tutorial-custom-images) to create VMs based on unique configurations or less common versions or distributions of an operating system.
