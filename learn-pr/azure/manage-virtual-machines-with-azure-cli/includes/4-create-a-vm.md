The Azure CLI includes the `vm` command to work with virtual machines in Azure. We can supply several subcommands to do specific tasks. The most common include:

| Sub-command | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `create`    | Create a new virtual machine |
| `deallocate` | Deallocate a virtual machine |
| `delete` | Delete a virtual machine |
| `list` | List the created virtual machines in your subscription |
| `open-port` | Open a specific network port for inbound traffic |
| `restart` | Restart a virtual machine |
| `show` | Get the details for a virtual machine |
| `start` | Start a stopped virtual machine |
| `stop` | Stop a running virtual machine |
| `update` | Update a property of a virtual machine |

> [!NOTE]
> For a complete list of commands, you can check the [Azure CLI reference documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/reference-index?view=azure-cli-latest).

Let's start with the first one: `az vm create`. This command is used to create a virtual machine in a resource group. There are several parameters you can pass to configure all the aspects of the new VM. The three parameters that must be supplied are:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `resource-group` | The resource group that will own the virtual machine. |
| `name` | The name of the virtual machine - must be unique within the resource group. |
| `image` | The operating system image to use to create the VM. |

In addition, it's helpful to add the `--verbose` flag to see progress while the VM is being created. 

## Create a Linux virtual machine

Let's create a new Linux virtual machine. Execute the following command in Azure Cloud Shell:

```azurecli
az vm create --resource-group <rgn>[Sandbox resource group name]</rgn> --name SampleVM --image Debian --admin-username aldis --generate-ssh-keys --verbose 
```

This command will create a new **Debian** Linux virtual machine with the name `SampleVM`. Notice that the Azure CLI tool is blocked while the VM is being created. If you would prefer not to wait, you can use the `--no-wait` option to tell the Azure CLI tool to return immediately, for example if you're executing the command in a script. Later in the script, use the `azure vm wait --name [vm-name]` command to wait for the VM to finish being created.

If you look at the verbose responses, you will also see that the `SampleVM` name is used to name various dependencies for the VM.

```

Succeeded: SampleVMVNET (Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks)
Accepted: vm_deploy_vzKnQDyyq48yPUO4VrSDfFIi81vHKZ9g (Microsoft.Resources/deployments)
```

You can override these auto-generated resource names using optional parameters to `vm create`, such as `--vnet-name` and `--public-ip-address-dns-name`.

Notice that we are specifying the admin account name through the `admin-username` flag to be "aldis". If you omit this, the `vm create` command will use your _current user name_. Since the rules for account names are different for each OS, it's safer to specify a specific name. Common names such as "root" and "admin" are not allowed for most images.

We are also using the `generate-ssh-keys` flag. This parameter is used for Linux distributions and creates a pair of security keys so we can use the `ssh` tool to access the virtual machine remotely. The two files are placed into the `.ssh` folder on your machine and in the VM. If you already have an SSH key named `id_rsa` in the target folder, then it will be used rather than having a new key generated.

Once it finishes creating the VM, you will get a JSON response which includes the current state of the virtual machine and its public and private IP addresses assigned by Azure:

<!-- TODO: find out the default location! -->

```json
{
  "fqdns": "",
  "id": "/subscriptions/abc13b0c-d2c4-64b2-9ac5-2f4cb819b752/resourceGroups/ExerciseResources/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/SampleVM",
  "location": "eastus",
  "macAddress": "00-0D-3A-1A-D9-74",
  "powerState": "VM running",
  "privateIpAddress": "10.0.0.4",
  "publicIpAddress": "168.61.54.62",
  "resourceGroup": "ExerciseResources",
  "zones": ""
}
```

<!-- TODO: find out the default location! -->

> [!NOTE]
> Notice that the VM was created in the **eastus** location. By default, the virtual machine is created in the location identified by the owning region. However, sometimes you might want to associate the VM with an existing region, but actually have it spin up somewhere else in the world. You can do this by specifying the option `--location` parameter as part of the `az vm create` command.
