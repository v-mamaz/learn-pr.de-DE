You manage IT infrastructure for a growing e-commerce site. Business ia strong and your datacenter is starting to struggle to keep up with demand from your users. Your service fails when too many users connect at the same time. Plus, you face more scheduled and unscheduled maintenance windows than you'd like. 

Because your site is based in northern California, you also find that network delay is especially bad for users located in other regions, such as Europe and Asia.

You decide to move your e-commerce site to the cloud to help save costs. But how can Azure help make your site run better?

Managing networks on Azure isn't entirely different from managing on-premises networks.
