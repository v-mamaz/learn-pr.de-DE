Every system, architecture, and application needs to be designed with security in mind. A denial of service attack prevents you from doing business. Defacement of your website damages your reputation. And a data breach is perhaps worst of all. It can ruin hard-earned trust and cause significant personal and financial harm. As administrators, developers, and IT management, we all must work to guarantee the security of our systems. 

Let's say you work for shipping and logistics company Contoso Shipping. Contoso Shipping is in the process of moving a lot of their infrastructure to the cloud. Several physical servers in their datacenter are moving over to Azure virtual machines. The current plans involve a hybrid solution, with some of the servers remaining on-premises, but they will need a secure, high-quality connection between the new virtual machines and the existing network.

Additionally, Contoso Shipping has some out-of-network devices that are part of its operations. They are using network-enabled sensors in their trucks that send data to Azure Event Hubs. And delivery drivers use mobile apps to get route maps and record signatures for receipt of shipments. These devices and apps must be securely authenticated before data can be sent to or from them.
