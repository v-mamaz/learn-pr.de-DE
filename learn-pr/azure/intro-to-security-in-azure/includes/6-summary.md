In this module, we discussed the basic concepts for protecting your infrastructure and data when you work in the cloud.

**Defense in depth** is the overriding theme - thinking about security as a multi-layer, multi-vector concern. Threats come from places we don't expect, and they can come with strength that will surprise us.

Azure has out-of-the-box help for a great deal of the security issues we face. One of the first steps we should take is assessing how much help from Azure we can use based on whether we're leveraging IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS.

Azure Security Center centralizes much of the help Azure has to offer. It provides a single dashboard, with a view into many of your services, and helps make sure you are following best practices. Continuously updated machine learning algorithms help identify whether the latest threats are aimed at your resources. And it helps your organization mitigate threats.

Of course, this module is introductory. Security is a deep and complex topic, so whatever your cloud approach, an ongoing security education is necessary. But this module should get you started in the right direction, so you know what you need to learn next.
