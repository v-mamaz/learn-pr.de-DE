You're the system architect for a law firm. The firm has asked you to migrate key systems to Azure. Systems include the database of case histories, currently hosted by an on-premises SQL server and accessed from a desktop application. The SQL server also runs some custom in-house services to perform database maintenance. You've decided that a solution based on Azure virtual machines (VMs) will allow you to host your SQL server and continue using your custom services. You'll create an Azure virtual hard disk based on the contents of your existing on-premises server to ease migration.

In this module, you'll learn how to architect the optimal disk configuration for the VMs you create in Azure. You'll create virtual hard disks through the Azure portal and add them to VMs to create fully functional compute resources.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Create a VM in the Azure portal
- Create operating system disks and data disks in Azure VMs
- Choose between and create standard and premium disks
- Choose between and create unmanaged and managed disks
