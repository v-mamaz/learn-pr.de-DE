If you were to lose one or more components of your infrastructure, could your architecture handle it? If you experience a loss of data or identify data corruption, could you recover the data? Do you know what your requirements are to your customers for system availability and disaster recovery?

Imagine you work for a healthcare provider with several thousand physicians throughout the country. Your IT department has recently undertaken an effort to remove their data center footprint and move most of the IT systems to Azure. You have a mixture of in-house developed applications, open source, and off-the-shelf applications. Each with varying architectures and technology platforms. You want to make the journey to the cloud a success, and would like to learn what is needed to help make this possible.  

> [!NOTE]
> The concepts discussed in this module are not all-inclusive, but represent some of the important considerations when building a solution on the cloud. Microsoft publishes a broad set of patterns, guidelines, and examples on designing applications on Azure. It is highly recommended that you look through the content in the [Azure Architecture Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/) as you start planning and designing your architecture.

## Learning Objectives

In this module, you will:

- Leverage Azure services to design a highly available application
- Incorporate Azure's disaster recovery capabilities into your architecture
- Backup and restore on Azure to protect your application from data loss or corruption
