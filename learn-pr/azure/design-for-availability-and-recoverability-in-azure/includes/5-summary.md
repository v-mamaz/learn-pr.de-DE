We discussed how to make your application available and recoverable by architecting for high availability, disaster recovery, and backups. High availability is the ability to handle the loss or severe degradation of a component of a system. Disaster recovery is about *recovering from high-impact events* that result in downtime and loss of data. And, backups refer to restoring your data after a disaster has occurred. Following these three principles will help ensure your application is resilient.
