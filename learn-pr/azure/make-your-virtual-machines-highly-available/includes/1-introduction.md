Azure Load Balancer can help scale your cloud applications and improve the availability of your services.

Suppose you work as the server administrator responsible for your on-premises Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) application. The application is business-critical, and you want to minimize the downtime that results from server failure.

Your company is looking to take advantage of some of the scalability options in the cloud and wants to determine if the ERP application can be made highly available by adding more servers and load balancing network traffic. Your job is to determine if a load balancer is appropriate for this type of application, and if so, how to deploy and configure the system.

Here, you will identify internal and external workloads that are suitable for load balancing. You will learn how to choose between the basic and standard load balancer products. Finally, you will see how to create a load balancer, associate the load balancer with virtual servers, and configure the associated rules and probes.

## Learning objectives:

In this module, you will:
- Decide when to use a load balancer
- Identify the differences between the basic and standard Load Balancer editions
- Create a new load balancer
- Create virtual networks associated with a load balancer
- Configure load balancer rules
- Configure a load balancer health probe
