  title: 'Knowledge check: Blob Storage'
  questions:
  - content: Which of the following best describes a good strategy for creating storage accounts and blob containers for your app?
    choices:
    - content: Storage accounts and containers must be created manually in the Azure portal or with scripts before your app is deployed.
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: Storage accounts should be created up front, prior to app deployment, but container creation is commonly performed by applications on the fly.
    - content: Your app should create storage accounts as it needs them, but your deployment process should create all the containers your app needs up front.
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: Storage account creation is a management activity that generally should not be performed by applications.
    - content: You should create your app's storage accounts up front, before deploying your app, and let your app create the containers it needs.
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: Container creation is a common app activity. Applications can create containers they need on the fly.
    - content: A properly configured app should create all of the storage accounts and containers it needs on its own.
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: Storage account creation is a management activity that generally should not be performed by applications.
  - content: What kind of configuration is typically used to initialize the Blob storage client library within an app?
    choices:
    - content: An Azure username and password.
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: Usernames and passwords are not an authentication mechanism for Azure storage.
    - content: The storage account connection string.
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: A storage account connection string contains all the information needed by an application to connect to Blob storage, most importantly the account name and the account key.
    - content: A globally-unique identifier (GUID) that represents the application.
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: GUIDS are not an authentication mechanism for Azure storage.
    - content: The storage account datacenter and location identifiers.
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: Your application does not need to know information about the datacenter and location of a storage account to access it.
  - content: What happens when you call `GetBlockBlobReference` with the name of a blob?
    choices:
    - content: A new block blob is created in storage.
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: Getting a blob reference does not create a blob on its own, but it will create a blob if you use the reference to upload data and the targeted blob doesn't already exist.
    - content: A `CloudBlockBlob` object is created locally. No network calls are made.
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: Getting a blob reference does not make any calls to Azure Storage, it simply creates an object locally that can then be used to work with a stored blob.
    - content: An exception is thrown if the blob does not exist in storage.
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: Getting a blob reference does not check whether the blob already exists in storage.
    - content: The contents of the named blob are downloaded.
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: Getting a blob reference does not download any data on its own. However, once you have a reference, it can be used to download data from the targeted blob.
