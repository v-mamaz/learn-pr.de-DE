  title: 'Knowledge check: Blob Storage'
  questions:
  - content: Which kind of blob is the best fit for most storage scenarios?
    choices:
    - content: Byte blobs
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: '"Byte blobs" are not a type of blob.'
    - content: Page blobs
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: Page blobs are designed for high volumes of random-access reads and writes, such as when used by an Azure Virtual Machine to store a virtual hard disk.
    - content: Block blobs
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: Block blobs are usually the best choice for general-purpose storage needs.
    - content: Append blobs
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: Append blobs only support appending new data, not updating or deleting existing data.
  - content: Blobs provide *unstructured* data storage. What does *unstructured* mean?
    choices:
    - content: Blobs can't be organized or named, they are only collections of bytes.
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: '"Unstructured" refers to the nature of the data *in* blobs, not organization of the blobs within a storage account.'
    - content: There are no restrictions on the kinds of data you can store in blobs.
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: Blobs do not impose any kind of structure on your data, meaning your apps can store any kind of data in blobs.
    - content: Blobs can't contain structured data, like JSON or XML.
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: Blobs *can* contain structured data, but Blob storage does not interact with it in any way. It is your app's responsibility to recognize the structure of blob contents and handle them appropriately.
    - content: Data downloaded from blobs in is organized randomly and requires a special client library to make sense of it.
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: All blob manipulation, including downloading blob contents, can be accomplished by directly using the REST API without any client library. Data downloaded from blobs is not organized randomly.
