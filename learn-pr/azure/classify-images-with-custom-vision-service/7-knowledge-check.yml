  title: Using the Microsoft Custom Vision Service to perform image classification
  questions:
  - content: "When you're creating a new Custom Vision Service project, what is a domain used for?"
    choices:
    - content: "Helps you decide what to name your project"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "You can name the project anything you want. The domain doesn't interfere with that."
    - content: "Helps you decide how to structure your project"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "Projects have the same structure in terms of training images and predictions. The domain doesn't interfere with that."
    - content: "Optimizes a model for specific types of images"
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "Great! Proceed to the next part of the lab."
    - content: "Optimizes your training images for organization"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "Training images are organized by tag. The domain doesn't interfere with that."
  - content: "Why should you add a tag after uploading images?"
    choices:
    - content: "To help you organize your images in the project for later use"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "While tags do help organize images, that's not the full purpose of tags."
    - content: "To put the images in a category for training"
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "Great! Proceed to the next part of the lab."
    - content: "To generate a word cloud after training"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "The Custom Vision Service doesn't do anything with word clouds."
    - content: "You don't need to add a tag"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "In order for the image classification to work, you do need to add at least one tag."
  - content: "Are precision and recall related when you're measuring the model's performance?"
    choices:
    - content: "No"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "Precision and recall are related. You won't have a model that performs well if you have high precision and low recall."
    - content: "Yes"
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "Great! Proceed to the next part of the lab."
  - content: "Which ways can you perform a quick test on your model after training?"
    choices:
    - content: "Image file"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "While the service can do a quick test on image files, it can do others, too."
    - content: "Image URL"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "While the service can do a quick test on image URLs, it can do others, too."
    - content: "Web page of images"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "The service is unable to perform a quick test on just a web page with images on it."
    - content: "Image file and image URL"
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "Great! Proceed to the next part of the lab."
  - content: "What does marking 'Make default' from the Performance tab do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Marks the latest iteration of the model as the default iteration"
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "Great! Proceed to the next part of the lab."
    - content: "Marks the image URL endpoint as the default endpoint"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "The endpoints are constant regardless of the number of iterations on the model."
    - content: "Marks the image file endpoint as the default endpoint"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "The endpoints are constant regardless of the number of iterations on the model."
    - content: "Marks the current project as the default project to use"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "The project must be specified so the endpoint knows which one to use. The project ID is included in the URL on the Prediction URL tab."
  - content: "What is the name of the header for the prediction key to send with the prediction endpoint?"
    choices:
    - content: "Subscription Key"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "There is no subscription key used for the Custom Vision Service."
    - content: "Prediction Key"
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "Great! Proceed to the next part of the lab."
    - content: "Training Key"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "The training key is used to train new iterations on your model, but not to make predictions."
    - content: "API Key"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "There is no API key used for the Custom Vision Service."
  - content: "When you're using the prediction API, what else happens back in the Custom Vision Service portal?"
    choices:
    - content: "Images are tagged if they come back as unknown"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "Images are only manually tagged in the portal, not automatically."
    - content: "Images are loaded as untagged in the training set"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "Images have to be explicitly uploaded to be a part of the training set."
    - content: "Images are shown in the Predictions tab"
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "Great! Proceed to the next part of the lab."
    - content: "Nothing happens"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "The images are put in a certain part of the portal."
