In this module, we learned what cloud computing is and how it can help every business, from start-up to large enterprise. At this point, we should know what cloud computing is, however, we haven't talked about a specific cloud provider.

### Microsoft Azure

Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing platform. Azure provides over 100 services that enable you to do everything from running your existing applications on virtual machines to exploring new software paradigms such as intelligent bots and mixed reality.

Here are just a few kinds of services you'll find on Azure:

- **Compute** services such as VMs and containers that can run your applications
- **Database** services that provide both relational and NoSQL choices
