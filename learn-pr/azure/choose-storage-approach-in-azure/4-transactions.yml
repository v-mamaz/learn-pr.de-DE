  title: 'Transactions'
  questions:
  - content: "What kind of system does the product data need?"
    choices:
    - content: "OLAP"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "No, an OLAP system is best for data that requires complex queries or transactions, and doesn't require low latency. The product data needs to be modified quickly, and needs a low-latency, high-throughput system."
    - content: "OLTP"
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "Yes, OLTP systems support lots of users, have quick response times, handle large volumes of data, are highly available, and typically handle small or relatively simple transactions, which is perfect for the product data set."
  - content: "If the operations to update inventory and process payments were in the same transaction, and a user was attemtping to apply a store credit for the full amount and submitted the exact same order via phone and by laptop to an ACID-compliant database, what would happen?" 
    choices:
    - content: "The first order would complete, the remaining credit account would change to zero, and the second order would be updated to show that the user had no in-store credit remaining."
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "No, due to the Isolation in transactional databases, the two transactions are handled independently, and the first transaction would not modify the second in-process transaction until the second transaction completed and failed."
    - content: "One order would be processed and would use the in-store credit, and the other order would update the remaining inventory for the items in the basket, but would not complete the order."
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "No, due to the Atomicity in transactional databases, the second order would not update the remaining inventory for the failed order."
    - content: "One order would be processed and would use the in-store credit, and the other order would not be processed."
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "Yes, once the second order determined the in-store credit had already been used, it would roll back the transaction."
