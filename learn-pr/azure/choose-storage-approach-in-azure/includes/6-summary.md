In this module, you've learned how to classify data. You've also learned how to review what will be done with the data, the performance requirements, and whether your data requires transactions. With this knowledge in place for the specific data sets in the online retailing scenario, you learned why some Azure services are better suited to the job than others. You can now apply these learnings to future projects, when you're choosing which service to use for data storage.
