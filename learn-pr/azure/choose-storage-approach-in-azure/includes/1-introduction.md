Data comes in different shapes and sizes, and there isn't one storage solution that fits all. For example, an online retail website has a number of distinct data sets that are all used to run the business: product catalog data, media files like photos and videos, and financial business data. Each data set has different requirements, and it's your job to figure out which storage solution is best. The main factors that determine the best storage solution are: data category, data usage, and performance.
