Suppose you run a social networking site for professionals. You're allowing your users to upload their headshot images to be posted on their profile. To reduce workload on the web server, you want to create a serverless backend using Azure Functions to process this data. You want to create an image thumbnail and then save it off to permanent storage. 

The power of Azure Functions comes largely from the integrations if offers with a range of data sources and services. These integrations are defined with bindings. Using bindings, developers interact with other data sources and services without worrying about how the data flows to and from their function.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Explore what types of data sources can be accessed through bindings
- Read data from Azure Cosmos DB using Azure Functions
- Store data in Azure Cosmos DB using Azure Functions
- Send messages to Azure Queue Storage using Azure Functions
