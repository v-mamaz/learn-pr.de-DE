> [!TIP]
> In this module, we will be creating Azure resources. We recommend placing those resources in one resource group so you can easily remove them later. As you'll see, we recommend creating a resource group for this module with the name [!INCLUDE [resource-group-name](./rg-name.md)].  Later, when you are ready to remove these resources, you can follow the [Clean up resources](../8-summary.yml##clean-up-resources) section found at the end of the module.
