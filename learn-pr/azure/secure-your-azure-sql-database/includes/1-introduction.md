Suppose you work at an online retailer. It's your responsibility to make sure your database is as secure as possible, to protect both your customer data and your business data. 

Data security is critical when protecting your customer's privacy and your organizationâ€™s reputation. Businesses have closed due to financial damage or ruined reputations. Customers have had their data accessed unlawfully because of security breaches exposing their personal details, and again, possibly causing financial harm.  

A data breach happens when a hacker has gained access to critical information held in a database. This data is private and often highly sensitive information that is confidential to customers. It could include information to allow identity theft, it may hold passwords that customers use on other sites, or it might include details on associations that could be used to blackmail your customers. 

In many countries, there's legislation on security breaches that must be adhered to.

It's critical to monitor your database for potential threats to make sure you protect your customers' data. We'll look at ways to secure your database by configuring the database firewall, defining authentication levels, encrypting communication, and other techniques for database security.
