The [Azure Bot Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en*us/services/bot*service/), combined with [Microsoft QnA Maker](https://www.qnamaker.ai/), provide the tools developers need to build and publish intelligent bots that interact naturally with users using a range of services. In this module, you will create a bot using the Azure Bot Service and connect it to a knowledge base built with QnA Maker. Then, you will interact with the bot using Skype â€” one of many popular services with which bots built with the Azure Bot Service can integrate.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Create an Azure web app bot to host a bot.
- Create a knowledge base, populate it with data, and connect it to a bot.
- Implement bots in code and debug the bots that you build.
- Publish bots and use continuous integration to keep them up-to-date.
- Debug bots locally using Visual Studio Code and the Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator.
- Plug a bot into Skype and interact with it there.
