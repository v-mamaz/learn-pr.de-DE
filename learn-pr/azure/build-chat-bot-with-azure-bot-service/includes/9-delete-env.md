In this unit, you will delete the resource group containing the bot and all the resources associated with it. Deleting the resource group deletes everything in it and prevents any further charges from being incurred for it. Resource groups that are deleted can't be recovered, so be certain you're finished using it before deleting it.

1. Return to the blade for the "factbot-rg" resource group. Then, click **Delete resource group** at the top of the blade.

1. For safety, you are required to type in the resource group's name. (Once deleted, a resource group cannot be recovered.) Type the name of the resource group. Then, click the **Delete** button to remove all traces of this exercise from your Azure subscription.

After a few minutes, the resource group and all of its resources will be deleted. Billing stops when you click **Delete**, so you're not charged for the time required to delete the resources. Similarly, billing doesn't start until the resources are fully and successfully deployed.

## Summary

There is much more that you can do to leverage the power of the Azure Bot Service by incorporating [Dialogs](http://aihelpwebsite.com/Blog/EntryId/9/Introduction-To-Using-Dialogs-With-The-Microsoft-Bot-Framework), [FormFlow](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/uk_faculty_connection/2016/07/14/building-a-microsoft-bot-using-microsoft-bot-framework-using-formflow/), and [Microsoft Language Understanding and Intelligence Services (LUIS)](https://docs.botframework.com/node/builder/guides/understanding-natural-language/). With these and other features, you can build sophisticated bots that respond to users' queries and commands and interact in a fluid, conversational, and non-linear manner.
