When planning a solution in the cloud, there's always the challenge of balancing cost against performance. It can feel like a guessing game whether the selected options will stay within budget, or if we'll have a surprise on our next bill!

We need to be able to confidently answer several questions:

- What will this solution cost this fiscal year?
- Is there a configuration we could use to save money?
- Is there a way to estimate how a change would impact your cost and performance _without_ putting it into a production system?

In this module, we'll explore the tools you can use to answer these questions and more.

- Estimate costs with the Azure pricing calculator.
