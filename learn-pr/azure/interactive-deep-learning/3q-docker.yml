  questions:
  - content: 'What is CUDA?'
    choices:
    - content: CUDA is a parallel computing platform and API.
      isCorrect: true
    - content: CUDA is a super powerful GPU model provided by Nvidia and nicknamed after a famous hotrod from the 60s.
      isCorrect: false
    - content: CUDA is a deep learning architecture used for image classification.
      isCorrect: false
  - content: 'What is docker?'
    choices:
    - content: Docker is a framework for training neural networks.
      isCorrect: false
    - content: Docker is an open platform distributed applications.
      correctExplanation: Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications, whether on laptops, data center VMs, or the cloud.
      isCorrect: true
    - content: Docker is a platform for webapps.
      isCorrect: false
  - content: 'What is the main difference between Nvidia-Docker and Docker?'
    choices:
    - content: Docker runs on windows and Nvidia-Docker runs only on linux.
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: While this answer is correct, it is not the main difference.
    - content: Nvidia Docker provides support for Nvidia GPUs where as a Docker supports only CPUs
      isCorrect: true
    - content: Docker supports all GPUs Nvidia-Docker is more light weight since it only needs ot support Nvidia GPUs.
      isCorrect: false
  - content: 'What is one of the main dependency challenges faced when using the DSVM?'
    choices:
    - content: The DSVM is sandboxed and doesn't provide direct support for installing new packages.
      incorrectExplanation: DSVMs are Azure Virtual Machine images, pre-installed, configured, and tested with several popular tools that are commonly used for data analytics, machine learning, and deep learning training, they are customizable.
      isCorrect: false
    - content: The DSVM only supports CNTK and Cognitive Service dependencies.
      incorrectExplanation: DSVMs provide out of the box support for many popular frameworks such as PyTorch, Chainer, and Tensorflow.
      isCorrect: false
    - content: Certain deep learning frameworks and packages require different enviorments, GPU drivers and binary packages
      isCorrect: true
