Your company has compute workloads deployed to several regions to make sure you have a local presence to serve your distributed customer base. 

Your aim is to place a container registry in each region where images are run. This strategy will allow for network-close operations, enabling fast, reliable image layer transfers. 

Geo-replication enables an Azure container registry to function as a single registry, serving several regions with multi-master regional registries.

A geo-replicated registry provides the following benefits:

- Single registry/image/tag names can be used across multiple regions
- Network-close registry access from regional deployments
- No additional egress fees, as images are pulled from a local, replicated registry in the same region as your container host
- Single management of a registry across multiple regions

## Replicate an image to multiple locations

You'll use the `az acr replication create` Azure CLI command to replicate your container images from one region to another. In this example, you'll create a replication for the `japaneast` region. Update `<acrName>` with the name of your Container Registry.

```azurecli
az acr replication create --registry <acrName> --location japaneast
```

The output should look similar to the following:

```console
{
  "id": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/myACR0007/replications/japaneast",
  "location": "japaneast",
  "name": "japaneast",
  "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
  "resourceGroup": "myresourcegroup",
  "status": {
    "displayStatus": "Syncing",
    "message": null,
    "timestamp": "2018-08-15T20:22:09.275792+00:00"
  },
  "tags": {},
  "type": "Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/replications"
}
```

As a final step. You are able to retrieve all container image replicas created. You'll use the `az acr replication list` command to retrieve this list. Update `<acrName>` with the name of your Container Registry.

```azurecli
az acr replication list --registry <acrName> --output table
```

The output should look similar to the following:

```console
NAME       LOCATION    PROVISIONING STATE    STATUS
---------  ----------  --------------------  --------
japaneast  japaneast   Succeeded             Ready
eastus     eastus      Succeeded             Ready
```

Keep in mind that you are not limited to the Azure CLI to list your image replicas. From within the Azure portal, selecting `Replications` for an Azure Container Registry displays a map that details current replications. Container images can be replicated to additional regions by selecting the regions on the map.

## Clean up
<!---TODO: Update for sandbox?--->

At this point, you can cleanup the created resources by deleting the resource group. To do so, use the `az group delete` command.

```azurecli
az group delete --name myResourceGroup --no-wait
```

## Summary

You've now successfully replicated a container image to multiple Azure datacenters using the Azure CLI.
