  questions:
  - content: 'When you create an Azure Cosmos DB account, and you want to ensure it will grow with your application’s needs, what’s the minimum value you should set the throughput to?'
    choices:
    - content: 400 RU/s
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 400 RU/s is the minimum throughput you can set for an Azure Cosmos DB; however, databases created with an original throughput of 400 RU/s will not autoscale. 
    - content: 1000 RU/s
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: Correct! A throughput of 1000 RU/s is the minimum value to enable autoscaling of your database.
    - content: 1400 RU/s
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: Setting throughput to 1400 RU/s would enable your database to autoscale; however, it's not the minimum value you could set to enable autoscaling.
    - content: '250,000 RU/s'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: Setting throughput to 1400 RU/s would enable your database to autoscale; however, it's not the minimum value you could set to enable autoscaling.
  - content: 'If you plan on writing a 4-KB document to an Azure Cosmos DB database 100 times per second and reading the 4-KB document 500 times per second, how many request units should you provision to ensure your account is not rate-limited?'
    choices:
    - content: 400 RU/s
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: Sorry, you'd be rate-limited if you provisioned only 400 RU/s for this scenario. Take a look at the table and look for a 4-KB document that requires 500 reads per second and 100 writes per second.
    - content: 1000 RU/s
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: Sorry, you'd be rate-limited if you provisioned only 1000 RU/s for this scenario. Take a look at the table and look for a 4-KB document that requires 500 reads per second and 100 writes per second.
    - content: 1300 RU/s
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: Sorry, you'd be rate-limited if you provisioned only 1300 RU/s for this scenario. Take a look at the table and look for a 4-KB document that requires 500 reads per second and 100 writes per second.
    - content: 1400 RU/s
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: Correct! The table indicates that you'd need a minimum of 1350 RU/s to support this scenario. To ensure you aren't rate limited you should provision 1400 RU/s, as you need more than 1350 RU/s and request units are provisioned in units of 100 (1300, 1400, 1500, etc.).
