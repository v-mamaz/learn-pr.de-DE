Databases need to scale to meet both the data velocity and volume demands created by global audiences.

Suppose you work for an online retailer and your database needs to scale to accommodate an expanding product catalog. You also have a growing global customer base, and your customers expect quick responses to their queries and immediate updates to product availability.

Your database should scale automatically to account for new products, and it should have high throughput and low latency to keep pace with your customers' expectations.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Create a NoSQL database with Azure Cosmos DB
- Set the initial throughput volume for your database using request units
- Choose a partition key
- Create a database and collection in Azure Cosmos DB
