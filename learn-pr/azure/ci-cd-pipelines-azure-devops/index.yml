title: Build Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines using Azure DevOps
summary: Learn how to quickly build out Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines into Azure for your apps.
abstract: This module shows how you can use Azure DevOps Projects to quickly build out your CI/CD pipelines into Azure. It starts with creating an Azure DevOps project in the language and technology of your choice. This will create a VSTS account and a VSTS Team Project with a sample app in the git repo. It will also create a build and release pipeline that takes the sample app, builds it and deploys it into infrastructure it provisions for you up in Azure. Next it covers replacing the sample app with your app code. And finally, this module covers how to customize the build and release pipelines.
