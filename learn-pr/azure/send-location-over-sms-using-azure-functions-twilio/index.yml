title: Share your location as a text message using Azure Functions and Twilio
summary: Learn how to use location tracking on your phone mixed with Azure functions and Twilio to share your location with your friends as a text message. Create a cross-platform Xamarin.Forms app with a serverless back end. This app will get the user's location from their device and send it with a list of phone numbers to an Azure function. The function will then use a binding to a third-party service (Twilio) to send your location as an SMS message to all the phone numbers provided.
