  title: 'Knowledge Check - Optimize network performance'
  questions:
  - content: 'Network latency is'
    choices:
    - content: 'The amount of throughput available on the network'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 'Network throughput is a measure of capacity, and is not the same as network latency.'
    - content: 'The amount of time it takes for information to be sent from a source to a destination'
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: 'The amount of time it takes for information to be sent from a source to a destination is known as network latency.'
    - content: 'The TTL of an asset in my content delivery network'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 'The TTL of an asseet on a content delivery network relates to how often it is refreshed from the original source, and is not related to network latency.'
    - content: 'A private circuit between an on-premises network and Azure'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 'ExpressRoute is a private circuit between an on-premises network and Azure, and while it can improve latency, it is not a defintion of the term.'
  - content: 'Our web application is hosted in East US. Which of the following would optimize network latency for users that are located around the globe in the most cost effective manner?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Deploy ExpressRoute to each of your users'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 'ExpressRoute is provisioned for a network location, not per user. While it may improve performance for users at that location, users outside of that location will not use ExpressRoute and therefore their performance will not be impacted.'
    - content: 'Use a content delivery network to place assets and content closer to your users'
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: 'By using a content delivery network, assets are cached at locations that are physically closer to end users and will reduce the amount of time to load them. This will cost-effectively improve network latency for users around the globe.'
    - content: 'Use Traffic Manager in performance routing mode'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 'Traffic Manager is a DNS load balancer that can help improve the time to connect to resources, but would also require locating web services in multiple locations and is not the most cost-effective way to address this problem.'
    - content: 'Deploy more instances in East US to server the extra user load'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 'Adding more instances will increase the amount of load the service in East US can handle, but will not address the network latency for users distributed globally.'
