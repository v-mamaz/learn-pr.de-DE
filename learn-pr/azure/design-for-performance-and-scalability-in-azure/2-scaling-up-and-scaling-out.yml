quiz:
  title: 'Knowledge check - Scaling up and scaling out'
  questions:
  - content: 'Which is the most accurate description of scaling out?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Increasing the amount of resources of an instance'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 'Increasing the amount of resources of a single instance is a description for scaling up'
    - content: 'Increasing the number of instances serving requests'
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: 'This is correct. Scaling out increases the number of instances service requests.'
    - content: 'Adding additional storage to a virtual machine'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 'Adding additional storage is not an example of scaling out.'
    - content: 'Reaching the maximum level of scale for your application'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 'Reaching the maximum level of scale for your application can be addressed by scaling out, but is not an accurate description of scaling out.'
  - content: 'Which is the most accurate description of scaling down?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Decreasing the number of instances serving requests'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 'Decreasing the number of instances serving requets is scaling in'
    - content: 'Taking ownership of how your application scales'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 'Taking ownership of how your application scales is not scaling down.'
    - content: 'Decreasing the amount of resources of an instance'
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: 'Scaling down is the reduction of resources that a single instance has available.'
    - content: 'Not yet reaching the maximum level of scale for your application'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 'This is not a description of scaling down.'
  - content: 'Which of the following is NOT a consideration when building a scaling strategy into your application?'
    choices:
    - content: 'The backup retention policies for your instances'
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: 'While it is importatnt to define the backup retention policies, it is unrelated to the ability of your application to scale.'
    - content: 'State management of your application'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 'State management is important to consider when building a scaling strategy. The ability to scale well will depend on the ability to store user state outside of the individual instances to ensure user experience is not broken as additional instances are added and removed.'
    - content: 'Startup time of your instances'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 'Startup time is an important consideration in a scaling strategy. As the time to start an instance increases, the more time you need to allow for your application to scale.'
    - content: 'Automating the scaling of your instances based on some metric or schedule'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 'Scaling automation is an important piece of a scaling strategy. As you automate your scaling capabilities you willll have greater ability to handle fluctuations in user load without manual intervention or poor user experience.'
