  title: 'Knowledge Check - Optimize storage performance'
  questions:
  - content: 'What is polyglot persistence?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Using Azure SQL Database to store all of your data'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 'Storing all data in a single technology is not the definition of polyglot persistence.'
    - content: 'A way to keep connections alive for data transfers'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 'Keepalives are methods of keeping connections alive for data transfers and are not related to polyglot persistence.'
    - content: 'The usage of different data storage technologies for different purposes in your application'
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: 'Polyglot persistence is the usage of different data storage technologies for different purposes.'
    - content: 'An approach to deal with transient data faults'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 'While dealing with transient data faults is beneficial in an application architecture, it is not related to polyglot persistence.'
  - content: 'Redis Cache can be used to improve the performance of your application by storing a snapshot of data in memory.'
    choices:
    - content: 'True'
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: 'Redis Cache will store application data in memory, leading to fast retrieval times and an improvement in application performance related to frequently accessed data.'
    - content: 'False'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 'Redis Cache will store application data in memory, leading to fast retrieval times and an improvement in application performance related to frequently accessed data.'
