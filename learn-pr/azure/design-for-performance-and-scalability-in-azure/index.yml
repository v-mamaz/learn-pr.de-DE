  title: Design for performance and scalability in Azure
  description: Whether you're running a public facing application that has to handle massive amounts of traffic or an internal business API that handles critical data for internal systems, your users expect a system that performs well. Scaling your system to handle load, identifying network bottlenecks and optimizing your storage performance are important to ensure your users have the best experience. In this module we'll talk through how to make your application perform at its best.
