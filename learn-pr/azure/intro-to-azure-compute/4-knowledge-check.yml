    title: Introduction to Azure compute knowledge check
    questions:
    - content: "Imagine that your astronomy team is small and that, while the members of your team are top notch astronomers and computer programmers, they have only a rudimentary understanding of server and web administration. Which of the following options should you choose?"
      choices:
      - content: "Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)"
        isCorrect: false
