Imagine that you are an astronomy professor at a college. You need to analyze a large dataset being generated for a new research project, but you don't have any free servers to do the work. And if you did, you'd need to find the time to install an operating system and the software to perform the work. 

You could buy new equipment, but budget is always a consideration, and you don't want to buy more hardware than you need, and you might not have a use for the new equipment after the project is complete. And unfortunately, you don't know how much data will be generated by the research project.

Ideally, you'd like to be able to provision the resources you need to do the work without too much administration, perform the work, and then get rid of the resources. And ideally, you'd pay only for the compute resources you need while you're using them.

This is exactly what we can do in Azure. We can create compute resources, configure them to do the work we need, and pay only for what we use.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Identify compute options in Azure.
- Select compute options that are appropriate for your business.
