Azure provides multiple services to perform cloud compute. Choosing the right service depends on your business needs. But notice that there is some overlap in capabilities. For example, you could use either Azure containers or Azure functions as part of a serverless architecture. Making the right decision depends on both the service capability and the experience and preferences of your development team.
