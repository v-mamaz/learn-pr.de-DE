Suppose you work as a network manager at a global pharmaceutical company that sequences genes to create formulas for proprietary and commercially confidential medicines. These formulas are used by your manufacturing plants around the world. To provide greater agility, the company is looking to implement Microsoft Azure and transfer part of its gene sequencing functions into virtual machines running in the cloud. The results of the data processing need to be available to multiple regions around the world. Currently, this processing is carried out in on-premises datacenters, with virtual private networking (VPN) used to connect the datacenters in each region.

You have been tasked to assess how Microsoft Azure implements networking and to identify whether it will provide suitable security for the transfer of data between your on-premises datacenter and Microsoft Azure, and between Microsoft Azure regions. You'll use Azure Virtual Network, Azure VPN Gateway, and Azure ExpressRoute technologies.
