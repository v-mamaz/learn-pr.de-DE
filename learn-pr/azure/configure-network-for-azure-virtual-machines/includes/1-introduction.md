Suppose you work as a network manager at a global pharmaceutical company that sequences genes to create formulas for proprietary and commercially confidential medicines. These formulas are used by your manufacturing plants around the world. The company wants to implement Microsoft Azure and transfer part of its gene sequencing functions into cloud-based virtual machines. The gene sequencing results need to be available to several regions around the world. Data processing is currently carried out in on-premises datacenters, with virtual private networking (VPN) used to connect the datacenters in each region.

You've been tasked to assess how Microsoft Azure implements networking and to identify whether it will provide suitable security for the transfer of data. Secure data transfer is required between your on-premises datacenter and Microsoft Azure, and between Microsoft Azure regions. You'll use Azure Virtual Network, Azure VPN Gateway, and Azure ExpressRoute technologies.
