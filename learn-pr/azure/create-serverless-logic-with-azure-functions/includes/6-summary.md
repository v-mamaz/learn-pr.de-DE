You've learned how to use Azure Functions to host business logic services in the cloud. It's a great way to add hosted services to your solution that can scale and grow with your business. You focus on the code using the language of your choice, and Azure manages the infrastructure. Functions can integrate with other services, like Event Grid, GitHub, Twilio, Microsoft Graph, and Logic Apps to create complex and robust serverless workflows quickly and easily.
