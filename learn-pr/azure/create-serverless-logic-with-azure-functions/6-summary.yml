  title: 'Knowledge check: Create serverless logic with Azure Functions'
  questions:
  - content: Which of the following best defines serverless logic?
    choices: 
    - content: Code you write that doesn't run on servers. 
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation:  Serverless doesn't mean there are no servers. It just means the developer doesn't have to worry about servers.
    - content: Code you write that runs on servers you manage.
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: A key benefit of serverless is that you don't have to manage underlying server infrastructure.
    - content: Code you write that runs on servers Azure manages.
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: Serverless doesn't mean there are no servers - it just means the developer doesn't have to worry about servers. Instead, a cloud provider such as Azure manages servers. 
  - content: The container that groups functions into a logical unit for easier management, deployment, and sharing of resources is called? 
    choices: 
    - content: Resource group 
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: A resource group is used to group a set of general Azure resources together.
    - content: Function app
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: A function app is a way to organize and collectively manage your functions. A function app is comprised of one or more individual functions that are managed together by Azure App Service. All of the functions in a function app share the same pricing plan, continuous deployment and runtime version. 
    - content: Function collection
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation:  A function collection is not the term used for the container of functions. 
  - content:  In the exercise in this module, we secured our functon against unknown HTTP callers by requiring a function-specific API key be passed with each call. Which of the following is the name header in the HTTTP requests that needs to contain this key?
    choices: 
    - content: "x-functions-key"
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation:  The API can be included in a query string variable named "code",  or it can be included in an x-functions-key HTTP header
    - content: "x-requested-with"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: This header is mainly used to identify Ajax requests.
    - content: "x-csrf-token"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: This header is used in HTTP requests to prevent cross-site request forgery.
