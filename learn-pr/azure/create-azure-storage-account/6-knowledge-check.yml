  title: "Knowledge check: Create a storage account"
  questions:
  - content: "Suppose you have two video files stored as blobs. One of the videos is business-critical and requires a replication policy that creates multiple copies across geographically diverse datacenters. The other video is non-critical, and a local replication policy is sufficient. True or false: To satisfy these constraints, the two blobs will need to be in separate storage accounts."
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "Replication policy is a characteristic of a storage account. Every member in the storage account must use the same policy. If you need some data to use the geo-replication strategy and other data to use the local replication strategy, then you will need two storage accounts."
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: false
  - content: "The name of a storage account must be:"
    choices:
    - content: "Unique within the containing resource group."
      isCorrect: false
    - content: "Unique within your Azure subscription."
      isCorrect: false
    - content: "Globally unique."
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "The storage account name is used as part of the URI for API access, so it must be globally unique."
  - content: "In a typical project, when would you create your storage account(s)?"
    choices:
    - content: "At the beginning, during project setup."
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "Storage accounts are usually stable for the lifetime of a project. It is common to create them at the start of a project."
    - content: "After deployment, when the project is running."
      isCorrect: false
    - content: "At the end, during resource cleanup."
      isCorrect: false
