The Eclipse integrated development environment (IDE) is used for Java development by a lot of developers. It is a great choice for connecting your Java application to your Azure subscription, as there are many tools readily available. The Azure Toolkit for Eclipse provides templates and features to simplify using Azure in your Java applications.

## Eclipse

The most widely used IDE by Java developers is Eclipse. It is a very versatile development environment, which has an extensible plugin architecture that can be used to support other languages apart from Java. While the majority of Eclipse users are Java developers, a lot of other disciplines are also using Eclipse, including C++, Python, C, and Ruby. It receives regular annual updates to keep the IDE modern and up-to-date.

Eclipse is used for large enterprise apps, and many of these are likely to require connections to Microsoft Azure services and products.

## Azure Toolkit for Eclipse

The Azure Toolkit for Eclipse provides templates and functionality that you can use to easily create, develop, test, and deploy cloud applications to Azure from inside the Eclipse IDE.

The toolkit includes integration templates for Docker containers, HDInsights, Azure documentation, Azure Redis Cache, storage account operations, and virtual machine management.

## Installation of Eclipse with Azure tooling

Eclipse is supported on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The installation process uses the Eclipse installer on all platforms, varying only in the general installation procedure between the platforms.

Installing Eclipse for Java or Java EE on any platform is straight-forward, and looks like any other installation on the chosen platform. The installer also prompts the user to choose the packages to install depending on the target language and frameworks.

## The Azure Toolkit for Eclipse

Because the Azure Toolkit is installed through the Eclipse IDE itself, it is the same procedure on all the supported operating systems. The toolkit itself is available from the Eclipse Marketplace.

The entire toolkit is open source and hosted in GitHub. It is frequently updated to consistently work with new features and updates on the Azure cloud platform.

## Summary

In this section, you have learned how simple and easy it is to get started creating Java applications by using Eclipse and the Azure Toolkit. Once installed, the toolkit provides a multitude of easy-to-use templates and features that makes Azure integration simpler and more efficient.

Both Eclipse and the Azure Toolkit are frequently updated, and provide a stable and efficient way to write Java applications with cloud integration.
