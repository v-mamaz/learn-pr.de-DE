Microsoft Azure enables you to quickly and efficiently build, deploy, monitor, and scale cloud hosted solutions. Azure's deployment model is flexible. You could, for example, develop in Visual Studio, commit your code to GitHub, build with Visual Studio Team Services, and then deploy to Azure. Or you could use a different integrated development environment (IDE) like Eclipse, develop on Linux, and even deploy directly from your development machine to the cloud.

Using Azure means you use your favorite IDE, you choose from a large range of development languages, from C# to Java to Node.js, and you choose your development operating system. Microsoft provides and supports a wide range of development tools for Windows, Linux, and macOS. 

In this module, you'll learn how to set up your development environment with several popular IDEs.

## Learning objectives
