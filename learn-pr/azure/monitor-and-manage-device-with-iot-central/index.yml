  title: Monitor and manage your coffee machine with Azure IoT Central
  description: In this tutorial you connect Azure IoT Central, a SaaS solution, to a simulated coffee machine to monitor and manage issues. In Azure IoT Central, you create your device template to define measurements (telemetry and state), settings, properties, and commands. Once your coffee machine is connected, you then take action on the state of the machine to remediate simulated issues when the rules trigger emails from IoT Central and mobile notifications from Microsoft Flow.

title: Monitor and manage your coffee machine with Azure IoT Central
summary: In this tutorial you connect a simulated coffee machine to the Azure IoT Central application to monitor and manage issues. In Azure IoT Central, the data that a device can exchange with your application is specified in a device template that defines the behavior and capability of a device or in this case, a coffee machine. You begin by creating a device template where you define measurements (telemetry and state), settings, properties, and commands for the coffee machine. Once your coffee machine is connected, rules in IoT Central can use data from your device to identify issues. When an issue is detected, IoT Central can generate emails and mobile notifications. You can then take action to remediate an issue with the coffee machine. To complete units 1–4, you need a Microsoft account, a 7-day free trial of Azure IoT Central application, and Node.js version 4.0.x or later installed on your machine. If you wish to complete the exercise on using Microsoft Flow to send a mobile notification in unit 5, you need to extend the IoT Central trial to 30 days. The extension is enabled if you have an Azure subscription.
