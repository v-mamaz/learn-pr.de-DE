We will be talking to our MongoDB data store from a web application. For the MEAN stack, this means installing the Node.js open-source JavaScript runtime. Node.js will act as our server-side host for our web application and its content.

## Node.js versions

There are two recommended versions of Node.js that are available:

- **Long Term Support (LTS)** - A version that's recommended for most users and for production environments.
- **Current** - A version that contains the latest features, but it can introduce breaking changes between release cycles.

In this module, we're going to use Node.js LTS, version 8.11.4 as of this writing.

## How to install Node.js

Node.js can be installed on most platforms. We will continue to install MEAN stack components on Ubuntu Linux. For information on how to install Node.js on other operating systems, check out the [Node.js instructions for installing it via various package managers](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

On Ubuntu Linux, you use the **apt-get** package manager to install Node.js.
