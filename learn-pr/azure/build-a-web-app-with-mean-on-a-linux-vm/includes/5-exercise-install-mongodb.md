In this unit, you will install MongoDB on your Ubuntu Linux virtual machine to act as a data store for your upcoming sample web application.

## Connect to the VM

In order to install MongoDB, you have to connect to the VM using **ssh**. Substitute your admin username and your VM's public IP address from above for the `<vm-admin-username>` and `<vm-public-ip>` placeholders.

```bash
ssh <vm-admin-username>@<vm-public-ip>
```

## Install MongoDB

> [!Important]
> Ubuntu provides an unofficial package called **mongodb**. This package is not maintained by MongoDB Inc.

1. Import the encryption key for the MongoDB repository. This will allow the package manager to verify that the mongodb packages you install are coming from MongoDB Inc.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 9DA31620334BD75D9DCB49F368818C72E52529D4
    ```

    The **sudo** command means that we want to run the specified command with administrative privileges.

1. Register the MongoDB Ubuntu repository so the package manager can locate the mongodb packages.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This command is different for different versions of Ubuntu. To find out which version of Ubuntu you're using, run: `uname -v`.
    > This command will output something like this: `#21~16.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Fri Aug 10 12:36:09 UTC 2018`.
    >
    > This output indicates that we're running Ubuntu version 16.04.1.
    > Refer to the [Install MongoDB Community Edition on Ubuntu](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/) documentation to get the exact command for your version.

    On Ubuntu 16.04, we run this command:

    ```bash
    echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu xenial/mongodb-org/4.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.0.list
    ```

1. Reload the package database so we have the latest package information.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

1. Install the MongoDB package onto our VM.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org
    ```

1. Start the MongoDB service so you can connect to it later.

    ```bash
    sudo service mongod start
    ```

## Summary

We now have MongoDB installed on our Ubuntu Linux VM. MongoDB will serve as your backing data store for the information you save and retrieve in your web application.
