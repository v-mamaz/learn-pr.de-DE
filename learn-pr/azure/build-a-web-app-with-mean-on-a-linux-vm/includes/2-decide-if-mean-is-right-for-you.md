The MEAN stack is a development stack for building and hosting web applications. MEAN is an acronym for MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js, the component pieces of this development stack.

## Why would I pick MEAN?

All of the components of the MEAN stack are reliable, well-understood, and open source, but so are many other development stacks. 

One of the biggest reasons to pick the MEAN stack for web development is if you're familiar with JavaScript. All of the individual components are developed using JavaScript, from the dev-ops tasks of the web hosting runtime and database configuration to developer tasks of web application code and client-side scripting.

Additionally, the components of the MEAN stack are all popular right now. Up-to-date documentation and tutorials for developing with MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js are easy to find. The components of the MEAN stack are compatible with modern operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. 

## Why might MEAN not be right for me?

If your data is highly normalized, you might still benefit from putting your data in MySQL or SQL Server, where the relational database architecture will match your data needs well.

If JavaScript is not your strongest skill, other frameworks and runtimes can serve you well. An alternative like the LAMP stack, which consists of Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP (sometimes with Perl or Python instead), might allow you to make more progress with a programming language more familiar to you. This variety of technologies will restrict your JavaScript development to the web application's client-side code.

You want to pick a development and hosting stack that works well for your skills and the skills of your development and dev-ops team.
