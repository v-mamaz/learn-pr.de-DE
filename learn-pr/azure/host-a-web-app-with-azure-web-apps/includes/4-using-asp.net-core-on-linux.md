You've decided to use an open-source technology for building your web application. You know that ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform and open-source framework. You decide to develop your web app in a Linux environment using ASP.NET Core!

Web Apps in Azure allows you to use your favorite web technology. Whether you're most comfortable with Node.js, PHP, or .NET Core, Web Apps will work for you.

Here, you will create an ASP.NET Core application using the .NET command-line interface (CLI).

## What is ASP.NET Core?

ASP.NET Core is the latest evolution of Microsoft's popular ASP.NET web framework, a cross-platform, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-based, and internet-connected applications.

ASP.NET Core applications can be written to target the .NET Core Framework or the existing, full .NET Framework.

Being a cross-platform and open-source framework, you can build ASP.NET Core apps on a variety of platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Thus far, Microsoft offers the Visual Studio IDE for both Windows and macOS environments. In addition, the Visual Studio Code editor is cross-platform and compatible with them.

>To support building ASP.NET Core applications on different platforms, Microsoft introduced the .NET Core CLI tools to help you build, test, and publish your applications using a rich, consistent, and cross-platform set of APIs.

With ASP.NET Core, you can build web apps and services, IoT apps, and mobile back ends. ASP.NET Core applications can be hosted either in the cloud or on-premises.

By design, ASP.NET Core consists of an embedded web server and a runtime environment that runs the application code. The application code is written using a reworked ASP.NET MVC framework that relies on smaller modules and packages. The result is a smaller web application blueprint that is easy to maintain and host over cloud environments. The following illustration shows an ASP.NET Core application hosted in .NET Core and the external web server that handles internet http traffic.

ASP.NET Core applications are standalone **console** applications invoked through the **dotnet** driver tool. ASP.NET Core applications are not loaded into the IIS worker process, but rather, are loaded through a native IIS module called **AspNetCoreModule** that executes the external console application.

## How to create an ASP.NET Core web project

There are a few options for creating a new ASP.NET Core project:

- You can use Visual Studio (Windows and macOS versions) templates to generate a new project. Visual Studio offers a variety of templates that you can use to create web projects. For instance, you can use the **Empty** template to create a bare-bones ASP.NET Core project with the basic setup. In addition, you can use the **Web Application (Modal-View-Controller)** template to generate a full-fledged ASP.NET Core MVC application, with sample **controllers** and **views** that can help you start coding your application. The latest arrival is the **Web Application** project template that is used to create an ASP.NET Core project based on Razor pages and not on the traditional MVC project structure.

- You can use the .NET Core CLI tools to generate a new ASP.NET Core project. Microsoft maintains an almost common set of ASP.NET Core project templates for both Visual Studio and the CLI tools. The only difference with the CLI tools is that you need to type commands to create a new ASP.NET Core project.
> The .NET CLI tools make use of the **templating engine** to support different project templates.  To learn more, visit the GitHub repository for the [templating engine](https://github.com/dotnet/templating) used internally by the .NET CLI tools.

The above are considered the top tools for generating ASP.NET Core projects. However, there are more tools out there that you can search for and explore.

It's worth mentioning that the projects generated by the different tools can be slightly different, however, they all generate valid and optimized ASP.NET Core projects.

## .NET CLI tools

The .NET CLI tools, also known as .NET Core CLI, is a cross-platform tool that provides commands for creating and restoring packages, and for building, running. and publishing .NET applications from the command line without the need for a full-featured IDE.

The .NET CLI is installed as part of the .NET Core SDK. Multiple versions of the CLI can coexist on the same machine and run side by side.

To start using the .NET CLI, you need to install the relevant .NET Core SDK with respect to the environment that you are using to develop your app: Windows, macOS, or Linux. Go to [.NET Downloads](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download?initial-os=linux) and grab the .NET Core SDK for Linux. I am using an Ubuntu 18.04 OS running on top Windows 10 using VMware Workspace Player 14 to demonstrate the different commands offered by .NET CLI.

Open the command line and type the following:

```console
dotnet --version
```

This command displays the version of the .NET CLI installed.

Running the above command on my machine displays this: `2.1.302`.

Let us start exploring some of the popular commands of the .NET CLI.

The *dotnet* command has the following general syntax:

```console
dotnet [verb] [arguments]
```

The verb represents the action to execute. The arguments represent the list of input arguments that the verb requires in order to execute.

To get help on the *dotnet* usage and list all of the *verbs* available, and other related information, type the following command:

```console
dotnet --help
```

This command displays the following:

```console
.NET Command Line Tools (2.1.302)
Usage: dotnet [runtime-options] [path-to-application]
Usage: dotnet [sdk-options] [command] [arguments] [command-options]

path-to-application:
  The path to an application .dll file to execute.

SDK commands:
  new              Initialize .NET projects.
  restore          Restore dependencies specified in the .NET project.
  run              Compiles and immediately executes a .NET project.
  build            Builds a .NET project.
  publish          Publishes a .NET project for deployment (including the runtime).
  test             Runs unit tests using the test runner specified in the project.

...
```

Under the **SDK commands**, you can see the entire list of commands that you can execute against the .NET Core SDK.

The most useful commands at all times are the following:

- **dotnet new**: This command is used to scaffold/generate a new .NET application.

- **dotnet restore**: This command is used to restore/download all packages that are referenced by the application.

- **dotnet run**: This command is used to run your .NET application.

Now, to get assistance on how to use a specific command, you can type the following:

```console
dotnet run --help
```

This command results in:

```console
Usage: new [options]

Options:
  -h, --help          Displays help for this command.
  -l, --list          Lists templates containing the specified name. If no name is specified, lists all templates.
  -n, --name          The name for the output being created. If no name is specified, the name of the current directory is used.
  -o, --output        Location to place the generated output.
  -i, --install       Installs a source or a template pack.
  -u, --uninstall     Uninstalls a source or a template pack.
  --nuget-source      Specifies a NuGet source to use during install.
  --type              Filters templates based on available types. Predefined values are "project", "item" or "other".
  --force             Forces content to be generated even if it would change existing files.
  -lang, --language   Filters templates based on language and specifies the language of the template to create.


Templates                                         Short Name         Language          Tags

Examples:
    dotnet new mvc --auth Individual
    dotnet new webapi
    dotnet new --help
```

This command lists all the available options that you can use with the `dotnet new` command. Also, it lists all the available project templates that you can use to generate your next .NET application. Finally, a section shows examples on how to use the command to generate a new .NET application.

You can learn the rest of the commands by using the `--help` argument for any command available in the .NET CLI.

## ASP.NET Core installation on Linux environment

The latest and greatest version of ASP.NET Core is v2.1. In general, ASP.NET Core ships as part of the .NET Core SDK. Therefore, by installing the .NET Core SDK on your machine, you can start developing with any .NET Core application, including ASP.NET Core web apps.

For this demonstration, I am using an Ubuntu 18.04 OS running on Windows 10, with the help of VMware Workstation Player.

To download the .NET Core SDK, you need to visit the [.NET Downloads](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) home page. The page contains links to download the .NET Core SDK on different platforms: Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Click on the **Linux** tab. You have two options:

- .NET Core SDK
- .NET Core Runtime

The .NET Core Runtime is already contained inside the .NET Core SDK. The runtime is used to run an application. All the tools to develop, test, run, and publish are inside the .NET Core SDK. Therefore, you will click on **.NET Core SDK**.

The Microsoft website redirects you to the download page. There, you need to select the **Linux Distribution**. In my case, I will select **Ubuntu 18.04**. Automatically, upon selection, the instructions on how to install .NET Core SDK on Ubuntu 18.04 is displayed.

## Summary

When deciding to build a web application, you have a choice of many languages and frameworks. Azure tries to make this choice easier by allowing you to host different types of applications, like Node.js, PHP, or .NET Core. This allows you to use the languages and frameworks that you're most comfortable with instead of changing to meet the needs of your web host.
