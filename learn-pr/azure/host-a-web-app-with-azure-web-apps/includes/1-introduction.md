Imagine you're building a website for a new business, or you're running an existing web app on an aging on-premises server. Setting up a new server can be challenging. You need appropriate hardware, likely a server-level operating system, and a web hosting stack.

And once it's running, you need to maintain the server. And what happens if your website traffic increases? You may need to invest in additional hardware.

Hosting your web application using the Web Apps feature of Azure App Service makes deploying and managing a web app much easier when compared to managing a physical server. In this module, we'll deploy a .NET Core web app to Web Apps in Azure.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Use the Azure portal to create your Web App
- Create an ASP.NET Core web app using Linux
- Upload your code to Azure App Service using Git
