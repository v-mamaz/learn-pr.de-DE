In this unit, you will use the Azure portal to create an Azure web app.

## Sign in to the Azure portal

The first step is to sign in to the Azure portal:

Open a browser and navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?azure-portal=true).

## Create an Azure web app

Now that we're logged into the Azure portal, let's create an Azure web app using the template.

1. Click the **Create a resource** link at the top of the left-hand navigation. Everything you create on Azure is a resource.

1. The portal navigates you to the **Marketplace** blade. From here, you can search for the resource you want to create or select one of the popular resources that people create in the Azure portal.

1. Click the **Web** > **Web App** resource. The portal redirects you to the **Create New Web App** blade.

1. When you create a new web app, the Azure portal requests some information to create the app for you. In this section, you need to provide the following basic information:

    1. **App name**: Your client wants to name the application `BestBike`. Type the name in this field. This value must be globally unique among all other web apps hosted on Azure, and the portal will make sure no one else has used the app name. To ensure your name is unique, add some numbers to your app's name until you find a unique variant.

    2. **Subscription**: In this field, you need to select an active Azure subscription from the drop-down list.

    3. **OS**: In this field, you need to decide whether to use **Windows** or **Linux** to host your new web app. This setting directly affects the App Service plan that you are going to select or create below. If you remember, an App Service plan resembles a virtual machine that is an operating system with all the resource (CPU, RAM, etc.) needed on that machine to run your application. In this case, your client prefers to host the web app over a Windows machine. Therefore, make the selection **Windows**.

    4. **Application Insights**: Azure Application Insights helps you detect and diagnose quality issues in your web apps and web services, and helps you understand what your users actually do with it. One of the requirements of your client is the ability to view some insight reports about the traffic coming over their website and to study some trends of when the traffic goes high and when it goes low. In this case, select the **On** option to turn on Application Insights for this web app. Once you select the **On** option, you are also required to select the location or region that will store the Application Insights data. Note that Application Insights are available in only a limited number of regions. For this demo, select the **East US** region in the **Application Insights Location** field.

## Create a new resource group

An Azure web app must be part of a resource group. Let's create one, to group together any related resources.

Select the **Create new** option (selected by default). Azure will generate a unique resource group name for you based on the app name you have chosen. You are free to change the resource group name or keep the one that Azure has generated. In this case, keep the name generated by Azure.

## Create an App Service plan

In this field, you need to select an App Service plan to run your application. By default, the portal selects the last App Service plan that you previously  created. Click on the **App Service plan/Location** field to navigate to the **App Service plan** blade.

Click on the **Create new** link to navigate to the **New App Service Plan** blade. The portal requests some information from you in order to create the new App Service plan.

1. **App Service plan**: In this field, you provide a globally unique name for the new App Service plan. For this app, type the same web app name you chose above and append a suffix of `-app-service-plan` to easily distinguish this resource from others.

2. **Location**: In this field, you need to select the region where this App Service plan resides. In other words, select the geographical location where the App Service plan will set up the virtual machine(s) that are required to run your application. In this case, you can select any of the options in the list. Your client prefers the hosting servers somewhere close to the East Coast, where the majority of their clients come from. Therefore, you will select **East US** as a value.

3. **Pricing tier**: In this field, you need to select the size of the virtual machine that is going to host your application. Click on the **>** sign to navigate to the **Pricing tier blade**.

    Here you have many options to choose from. The portal groups those options by the level of workload needed. The three workload categories available are Dev/Test, Production, and Isolated. Depending on the requirements of the application you want to host on Azure, you will select the relevant workload category. As the **BestBike** application is building and shaping up, you will start with the minimal workload category that works for you. Remember, one of the client's requirements was the ability to test live any new changes coming over the application. In the coming units, you will see that to achieve this requirement, you will need to add **deployment slots**. Deployment slots are available starting at a minimum pricing tier of **S1**. Therefore, select the **S1** pricing tier under the **Production Workload** category. Then, click on **Apply** to confirm the pricing tier you have selected above.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You will notice throughout this module that only **Production** and **Isolated** workload categories allow you to add **deployment slots** to your web app.

    Now, you are back to the **New App Service plan** blade.

4. Click the **OK** button to use your new App Service Plan.

    The portal navigates you back to the main **Create Web App** blade.

    ![Screenshot showing the new resource blade in Azure with the progression to find the Web App resource highlighted.](../media/3-new-web-app.png)

5. Click the **Create** button to start the process of creating the web app.

    > [!NOTE]
    > It can take a few seconds to get your web app created and ready for your use.

The portal redirects you to the dashboard page and notifies you once it creates the web app.

Once the app is ready, navigate to the new app in the Azure portal.

1. Click the **All resources** menu on the left side navigation. The **All resources** blade lists all the resources that you have created in the Azure portal.

2. Click through the BestBike App Service just created for you.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you search for your app by the name "BestBike", you may also find the Application Insights and App Service Plan resources created for your new web app. Make sure you are clicking through the resource with the type of **App Service**.

    ![Screenshot showing an example search result within the all resources blade with a newly created BestBike123 App Service highlighted.](../media/3-web-app.PNG)

The portal opens the web app service home page with the **Overview** section selected.

To preview your new web app's default content, click on the **URL** in the top right of the Azure portal. If you see a placeholder web page, it means you have successfully created the web app.
