Migrating an on-premises SQL server to the cloud has many benefits. You no longer need to manage server hardware, this includes both hardware upgrades and hardware failure, you can scale in response to demand on your server, and Azure provides security tools to keep your business and customer data safe.

Imagine you're a national online bicycle retailer. You're currently using an on-premises server to host your SQL database and have decided to move your system to the cloud by migrating your database to the Azure SQL database. Because your customer base is limited to one geographical area, you can afford to take your database offline for migration purposes during the off-peak business hours, such as overnight.

In this module, you'll learn how to migrate your SQL database to Azure. Before migration starts, you need to assess your current deployment and perform any required fixes to support an Azure migration.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Assess your SQL Server database for migration.
- Analyze and fix your database before migration.
- Migrate your database using the Microsoft Data Migration Assistant.
