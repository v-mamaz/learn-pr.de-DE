  title: 'Knowledge check - Design for efficiency and operations'
  questions:
  - content: 'What are the benefits of a pay-as-you-go cost model?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Full transparency into the costs of your resources'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 'This is a benefit that comes with a pay-as-you-go cost model, but is not the only correct choice.'
    - content: 'The flexibility to adjust your resources and costs to match demand'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 'This is a benefit that comes with a pay-as-you-go cost model, but is not the only correct choice.'
    - content: 'Reduced risk when evaluating new tools and technologies'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 'This is a benefit that comes with a pay-as-you-go cost model, but is not the only correct choice.'
    - content: 'All of the above are benefits of a pay-as-you-go cost model'
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: 'All of the above are benefits of a pay-as-you-go cost model'
  - content: 'Which of the following is an example of improving operational efficiency?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Automating the deployment of infrastructure'
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: 'Automating the deployment of infrastructure is a great example of improving your operational efficiency.'
    - content: 'Moving serivces from PaaS to IaaS'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 'Moving services fro PaaS to IaaS can be seen as a step backwards in operational efficiency, as PaaS services typically come with reduced operational costs.'
    - content: 'Documenting manual steps for the deployment of infrastructure'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 'Documentation is important with any architecture, but operational improvement comes with automating the manual activities as opposed to simply documenting them.'
    - content: 'Maintaining multiple logging systems'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 'Maintaing multiple logging systems comes with increased operational overhead and a reduced ability to correlate events and metrics across the logging systems. Centralizing on a single loggin system can improve operational efficiency.'
