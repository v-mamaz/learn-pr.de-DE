In this unit, you will learn how to work with blades in the Azure portal user interface (UI).

## Working with blades

1. In a browser, navigate to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true), and sign in.

2. Let's start by creating a resource. In the left-hand pane, click **Create a resource**.

3. The **New** blade displays a list of categories of items to create on the left-hand side, with the **Get started** option selected. This is like the "Favorites" menu, with some of the most common options visible. Under **Get started**, you have the option to create resources such as a Windows Server 2016 VM, an Ubuntu Server VM, a web app, a SQL database, and so on. Each of these items includes a quickstart tutorial.

4. Click **Quickstart tutorial** under Windows Server 2016 VM. This lists the Windows VM tutorials. Close this new tab to return to the Azure portal.

## Viewing resources

1. Under Azure Marketplace, click **Compute** to show more compute options, such as Red Hat Enterprise, Reserved VM instances, Web app for Containers, and so on. This list is a subset of the entire range of computing resources available.

2. To the right of **Featured**, click **See all** to see the full range of available resources. The full list of VMs now appears.

3. Under **Recommended**, click **Windows Server**. The **Windows Server** blade appears.

4. To the right of the **Pin** icon, click the **Maximize** icon. The Windows Server blade now fills the screen, except for the left-hand pane. Scroll down the list to see the other Windows Server images available.

1. On the **Compute** blade, look down the list of available VM images and then, at the bottom, click **Load More**.

1. Continue to click **Load More** a few times to appreciate just how many types of VMs Azure provides.

1. Click the **X** at the top right-hand corner to close the **Compute** blade.

1. Click the **X** at the top right-hand corner to close the **Marketplace** blade.

1. Click the **X** at the top right-hand corner to close the **New** blade.

The default dashboard now appears.
