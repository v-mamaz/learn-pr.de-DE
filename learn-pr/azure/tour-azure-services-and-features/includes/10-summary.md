However, this is just the beginning. Azure has so much to offer you, no matter what role you plan in your organization. If you are a developer, Azure provides an easy way to test new platforms and build sophisticated apps. If you are an administrator, you will use the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell tools to administer your cloud-based infrastructure. If you are an architect, you can use Azure to test out new architecture ideas quickly.
