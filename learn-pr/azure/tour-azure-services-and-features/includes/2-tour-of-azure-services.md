### Storage

Azure provides four main types of storage services. These services are:

- **Azure Blob storage** - provides storage for very large objects, such as video files or bitmaps
- **Azure File storage** - creates file shares that you can access and manage like a file server
- **Azure Queue storage** - implements a store for queuing and reliably delivering messages between applications
- **Azure Table storage** - consists of a NoSQL store that hosts unstructured data independent of any schema

Each of these services shares common characteristics, which are:

- Durable and highly available with redundancy and replication.
- Secure through automatic encryption and role-based access control.
- Scalable with virtually unlimited storage.
- Managed, handling maintenance and any critical problems for you.
- Accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS.

### Mobile

Azure enables developers to create engaging iOS, Android, and Windows apps quickly and easily in a wide range of languages using their choice of development environment. Features that used to take time and increase project risks, such as adding corporate sign-in and then connecting to on-premises resources such as SAP, Oracle, SQL Server, and SharePoint, are now simple to include.

Other features of this service include:

- Offline data synchronization.
- Connectivity to on-premises data.
- Broadcasting push notifications.
- Autoscaling to match business needs.
