Suppose you work for a company that processes fitness tracker data for runners. Your company tracks the runners' routes and performance using a relational database hosted on an on-premise server.

The company wants to expand by tracking additional fitness tracking models and types and do that it will need to scale its database, both for capacity and performance. You want to move away from your current on-premise databases servers without compromising security.

When you consider cloud hosted database offerings, some of the questions that you may have might be aspects such as availability, scalability, and security. Azure Database for PostgreSQL allows you to take advantage of built-in security, fault tolerance, and data protection that you otherwise have to buy or design separately, build, and manage.
