## Clean up

Although the Azure Sandbox will clean up your resources automatically for you when you are finished with this module, it is best practice at the end of a project to identify whether or not you still need the resources you created during it. Resources left running can cost you money. 

To remove all the resources that you created, you can delete them one-by-one, or just delete the resource group. Deleting a resource group will delete all the resources in the group.
